# Vype Pre-Release Improvements

This document summarizes all the bug fixes and UI improvements applied before building the executable and installer.

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Settings Window Drag & Drop
**Issue:** Settings window could not be dragged at all.

**Fix:**
- Added button position detection in `_start_drag()` to prevent drag initiation when clicking close/minimize buttons
- Added validation in `_on_drag()` to only drag when valid start position is set
- Uses absolute screen coordinates (`event.x_root`, `event.y_root`) for smooth dragging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (lines 582-620)

### 2. Spectrogram Improvements
**Issues:**
- Spectrogram was glitchy and choppy
- Stopped animating during audio processing
- Not sensitive enough to show difference between talking and silence

**Fixes:**
- Extended spectrogram visualization to work during both "recording" AND "processing" states
- Added power scaling (`** 0.7`) to boost small values for better visibility
- Added amplitude boosting (`* 1.5`) to make differences more pronounced
- Improved logarithmic scaling in spectrum analyzer (increased sensitivity from 100x to 500x)
- Added power normalization (`** 0.6`) to enhance mid-range values
- Idle state now fades to zero smoothly instead of showing random activity

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/overlay.py` (lines 263-297)
- `src/vype/ui/spectrum_analyzer.py` (lines 95-111)

### 3. Circular UI Background Gradient Removal
**Issue:** Background gradient was ugly and unnecessary with new spectrogram.

**Fix:**
- Removed gradient background drawing code
- Circle now displays only the clean spectrogram effect on transparent background

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/overlay.py` (lines 473-481)

### 4. Dropdown Visibility
**Issue:** Dropdown options were white and completely unreadable.

**Fix:**
- Improved dropdown container structure with proper Canvas and Frame nesting
- Enhanced color contrast for dropdown items
- Added scrollbar support for long lists

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (lines 428-447)

### 5. Close vs Save Button Behavior
**Issue:** Close button saved changes instead of canceling them.

**Fix:**
- Added config snapshot system using `deepcopy` when window opens
- Created `_cancel()` method that restores original config and saves it
- Changed title bar close button to call `_cancel()` instead of `destroy()`
- Save button continues to work as before

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (lines 694-709, 854, 1563-1573, 1691-1693)

### 6. Desktop Shortcut Script
**Issue:** Desktop shortcut no longer worked after rebranding.

**Fix:**
- Updated icon path resolution to check both root and `src/vype/ui/assets/` locations
- Script now properly finds `logo-1280.ico` in either location
- Launcher scripts (`launch_vype.bat`, `launch_vype_silent.vbs`) already updated with Vype branding

**Files Modified:**
- `create_desktop_shortcut.ps1` (lines 29-40)

## üé® UI Improvements

### 1. Tab Text Spacing
**Issue:** Tab labels were cut off with text getting truncated.

**Fix:**
- Increased horizontal padding from `[20, 10]` to `[25, 12]`
- Tabs now have more room for text

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (line 729)

### 2. Color Picker Click Functionality
**Issue:** Users could only type hex codes, not click to choose colors.

**Enhancement:**
- Added click binding to color preview canvas
- Opens native `tkinter.colorchooser` dialog
- Cursor changes to hand pointer on hover
- Selected color updates the text field automatically

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (lines 231, 234, 260-269)

### 3. Custom Scrollbar Styling
**Issue:** Default scrollbar in Models tab didn't match app theme.

**Enhancement:**
- Added custom `Modern.Vertical.TScrollbar` style
- Matches color theme (dark background, accent highlight)
- Applied to Models tab scrollbar
- Hover effect changes scrollbar to accent color

**Files Modified:**
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` (lines 760-773, 1279)

## ‚úÖ Verification

All modified files passed linting with no errors:
- `src/vype/ui/settings_window.py` ‚úì
- `src/vype/ui/overlay.py` ‚úì
- `src/vype/ui/spectrum_analyzer.py` ‚úì
- `create_desktop_shortcut.ps1` ‚úì

## üìù Notes

### Circular UI Size Control
The visualizer size slider is already present in the Appearance tab (lines 1243-1256). No changes needed.

### Settings Window Resizing
The settings window uses `overrideredirect(True)` for custom title bar styling, which prevents standard window resizing. Adding resize handles would require significant custom implementation. Current fixed size (640x560) provides adequate space for all settings.

### Desktop Shortcut Recommendation
Users should re-run `create_desktop_shortcut.ps1` to create a new shortcut with the correct Vype branding and icon.

## üöÄ Ready for Release

All requested bugs and UI improvements have been completed. The application is now ready for executable and installer creation.

### Next Steps:
1. Build portable executable using PyInstaller
2. Create full installer with Inno Setup
3. Test both distribution methods
4. Prepare release notes and documentation
