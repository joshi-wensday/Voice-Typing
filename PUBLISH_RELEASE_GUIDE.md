# üöÄ Publishing Vype v1.0.0 on GitHub

This guide will help you publish your release on GitHub so users can easily download the installer.

## üìã Overview

GitHub Releases is the **best way** to distribute your installer because:
- ‚úÖ Files up to 2GB are supported (your 77MB installer is perfect)
- ‚úÖ Download links are permanent and versioned
- ‚úÖ Users can easily find and download the latest version
- ‚úÖ You get download statistics
- ‚úÖ Release assets don't count toward repository size limits

## üéØ Step-by-Step: Creating the GitHub Release

### Option 1: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easiest)

1. **Go to your repository:**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing

2. **Go to Releases:**
   - Click on **"Releases"** in the right sidebar (or go to: https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases)

3. **Create a new release:**
   - Click **"Draft a new release"** button

4. **Fill in the release details:**
   
   **Choose a tag:**
   - Select **"v1.0.0"** from the dropdown (you already created this tag)
   
   **Release title:**
   ```
   Vype v1.0.0 - Initial Release üéâ
   ```
   
   **Description:**
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of `RELEASE_NOTES.md` into the description box
   - GitHub will render the markdown beautifully
   
5. **Attach the installer:**
   - Scroll down to the **"Attach binaries"** section
   - Click in the box or drag and drop the file:
     ```
     installer_output/vype-setup-v1.0.0.exe
     ```
   - Wait for the upload to complete (77MB will take a minute or two)

6. **Publish the release:**
   - ‚úÖ Make sure **"Set as the latest release"** is checked
   - ‚úÖ Leave **"Set as a pre-release"** unchecked (this is your stable release)
   - Click **"Publish release"**

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (For Advanced Users)

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
# Create the release with the installer
gh release create v1.0.0 \
  --title "Vype v1.0.0 - Initial Release üéâ" \
  --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES.md \
  installer_output/vype-setup-v1.0.0.exe
```

## ‚úÖ After Publishing

### What happens automatically:
1. ‚úÖ GitHub creates a permanent download link at:
   ```
   https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases/download/v1.0.0/vype-setup-v1.0.0.exe
   ```

2. ‚úÖ Users can visit the releases page to see all versions

3. ‚úÖ The "latest" link will always point to your newest release:
   ```
   https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases/latest
   ```

### Verify your release:
- Visit: https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases
- You should see your v1.0.0 release with the installer attached
- Click the installer link to test the download

### Update your README:
Your README is already updated with the correct download links! ‚úÖ

## üßπ Optional: Clean Up Large Files from Git History

Your installer is currently in your git history (from the commit that added it to `installer_output/`). 

**Why clean it up?**
- The 77MB installer makes cloning slower for developers
- GitHub warns about files over 50MB
- Release assets are separate from repository storage

**How to clean it up:**

1. **Remove from tracking (keep locally):**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached installer_output/vype-setup-v1.0.0.exe
   ```

2. **Add to .gitignore:**
   ```bash
   echo "installer_output/" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Remove installer from git tracking, available in releases"
   git push
   ```

**Note:** This won't remove it from git history, but it prevents future installers from being tracked. To fully remove from history, you'd need to rewrite history (not recommended after pushing).

## üìä Best Practices for Future Releases

### Version Naming
- Use semantic versioning: `v1.0.0`, `v1.0.1`, `v1.1.0`, `v2.0.0`
- Tag format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

### Release Workflow
1. Fix bugs / add features
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Build new installer with updated version
4. Create git tag: `git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Description"`
5. Push tag: `git push origin v1.0.1`
6. Create GitHub Release and attach installer

### Installer Naming Convention
- Format: `vype-setup-v{VERSION}.exe`
- Examples: `vype-setup-v1.0.1.exe`, `vype-setup-v1.1.0.exe`

## üåê Sharing Your Release

Once published, share your release:

**Direct installer link:**
```
https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases/download/v1.0.0/vype-setup-v1.0.0.exe
```

**Release page:**
```
https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases/tag/v1.0.0
```

**Latest release (always points to newest):**
```
https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing/releases/latest
```

**Repository README:**
```
https://github.com/joshi-wensday/Voice-Typing
```

## üìà Tracking Downloads

GitHub provides download statistics:
1. Go to your Releases page
2. Scroll down to "Assets"
3. Each file shows download count next to it

## üéâ You're Done!

Your application is now:
- ‚úÖ Available for download via GitHub Releases
- ‚úÖ Easy to install with the Windows installer
- ‚úÖ Properly documented in the README
- ‚úÖ Version tagged in git
- ‚úÖ Ready to share with the world!
